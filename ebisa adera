Final Project
Final Project: Chat Prompt for Osiri University Student Advising
1.Select Your Use Case
Use Case Overview:  
The chosen use case is student advising at Osiri University. Many students often feel overwhelmed when navigating course selections, academic requirements, and career paths. A chatbot can provide personalized guidance, answer common questions, and help students make informed decisions about their education.
2. Define the Chat Prompt's Purpose
Purpose Definition:  
The chat prompt will serve as a virtual advisor for Osiri University students. It will interact with users by asking questions to understand their academic goals and preferences, providing tailored course recommendations, and answering frequently asked questions about university policies, deadlines, and resources. The desired outcome is to enhance student satisfaction and academic success by simplifying the advising process.
3.Design the Chat Prompt
Initial Greeting and Tone:  
The chatbot will introduce itself with a friendly and professional tone:  
"Hello! I’m your virtual advisor at Osiri University. How can I assist you today in your academic journey?"
Context Understanding:  
The chatbot will utilize natural language processing to interpret user inputs. It will maintain context by tracking the conversation history and recognizing keywords related to courses, majors, deadlines, and general inquiries.
Follow-up Questions:  
Based on user responses, the chatbot will ask clarifying questions such as:  
▬"What major are you interested in?"  
▬"Are you looking for courses this semester or planning for the next?"  
▬"Do you have specific career goals in mind?"

Error Handling:  
In case of unclear or invalid inputs, the chatbot will respond empathetically:  
"I'm sorry, I didn't quite understand that. Could you please rephrase your question or provide more details?"
